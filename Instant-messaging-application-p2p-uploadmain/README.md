We made an instant messaging application using python language. 
server.py is the class where we create our server and write the codes, 
db.py is the class where our database is located, we did it using mysql,
user.py is the class where our users who use our application are defined and controlled, 
and finally templates is the folder where we design the web interface of our application, here we used html.
